# Hang on mate!

As a Python coding ninja, you already are equipped with the following skills:
- [ ] Variables, Arithmetic Operations, Keyboard Input
- [ ] Coding conventions of PEP8
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Conditional Statements
- [ ] Loops

To polish these more, aside from hanging out with us(lol), we are challenging you to do the never aging `Hangman` game!

## Getting Started

This exercise is from Michael Dawson's "Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner 3rd Edition".
We have given a template file to help you implement the game step-by-step but you could do your own from scratch
if that's easier for you.

Hang in there and let the game begin!

### Resources

You can use the template file here for this exercise.
