# Challenge yourself with 2048

Good job on learning the basic concepts of programming using Python! Before you say adieu to
our basic track and heading on to a more specific application of Python such as scripting, web application or data analysis,
we challenge you to do our *FUN* game-centered culminating project, [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)!

You might have played it before, but now that you are a coding ninja, you are going to implement it! Don't worry
because we will help you along the way and we assure you that finishing it will level up your skills. Plus,
it's a proud thing to share with your peers!

## Getting Started

This project is from Principles of Computing offered by Rice University in Coursera. Additional instructions
were added on the template file to help you implement the game step-by-step.

Let the game begin!

### Resources

Please use the files here for your project.

* [Instruction](https://github.com/enixdark/principlescomputing-001/blob/master/Week0/Instructions.md)
* [Starter kit](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/WWCodeManila-Python/tree/master/basic_concepts/exercises/2048)
    * logic.py
    * poc_2048_gui.py
    * requirements.txt
   
* Install the required library for the game GUI:

```shell
pip install simpleguitk
```

or

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* To run:
