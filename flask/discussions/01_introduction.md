# Fun, Friendly, Fabulous Flask
Congratulations, young'un, for coming this far!
Are you ready to enter the wonderful world of web development?

- [x] I have a text editor installed in my computer (e.g. Notepad++, Sublime).
- [x] I have Python installed in my computer.
- [x] I'm familiar with the basics concepts of Python.

If you answered **yes** to all three questions, then brace yourself, hang on to your handy Flask -- err, weapon, and let the adventure begin!

## Final Output

This course will help you create your own **portfolio** while exploring Flask. By the end of this course, you should be able to create and deploy your Flask web app.

## Flask in a nutshell
Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug (toolkit), Jinja 2 (templating engine) and good intentions. For more information, visit the official Flask site: http://flask.pocoo.org/.

## The "micro" in "microframework"
### Debunking the misconceptions about Flask as a microframework
* It is not lacking in functionality.
* We don't have to fit our whole web app into a single Python file (although we certainly can).
### What it really is
* It aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Check out the list of available extensions here: http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/.
* It won't make many decisions for you, such as what database to use.
* The decisions that it does make, such as what templating engine to use, are easy to change.
* Everything else is up to you. :)
* Flask can be EVERYTHING YOU NEED and NOTHING YOU DON'T.

## Reasons to love Flask
* Easy to learn: Flask's Hello World app has to be the simplest out there, clocking in at only 7 lines!
* Best for small apps with simple requirements
